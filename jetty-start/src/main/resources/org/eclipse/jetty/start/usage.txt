Usage: java -jar start.jar [options] [properties] [configs]
Run Jetty Server Standalone.

Common Options:
  --help           This help / usage information.
  --version        Print the version information for Jetty, then exit.
  --stop           Stop the running Jetty instance.

Advanced Options:
                   
  --list-options   List available options, then exit.
                   (see OPTION property in section below)
                   
  --dry-run        Print the command line that the start.jar generates,
                   then exit. This may be used to generate command lines
                   when the start.ini includes -X or -D arguments.
                   On unix, the resulting command line can be run with 
                     eval $(java -jar start.jar --dry-run)
                   This is more efficient than the --exec option, which
                   creates a second JVM instance
                   
  --exec           Run the generated command line (see --dry-run) in 
                   a sub processes.  This can be used when start.ini
                   contains -X or -D arguments, but creates an extra
                   JVM instance.
                   
  --secure         Enable Security:
                     * JVM Security Manager
                     * Security Policies
                     * Secure Logging
                     * Audit Logging
                   

If the file start.ini exists in the working directory, then it's each line
of it's contents is prepended to the as an argument to the command line.

Properties:
Execution properties, similar in scope to JVM Properties.
NOTE: Not all properties are listed here.
  org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.class=[class]   
      A Low Level Jetty Logger Implementation to use
      (default: org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.Slf4jLog)
  org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.stderr.DEBUG=[boolean]
      Debug logging for the stderr and javautil Loggers. Slf4j
      and other loggers must be separately configured for debug.
      (default: false)
  org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.IGNORED=[boolean]
      Ignored exceptions are logged, independent of DEBUG settings
      (default: false)
  STOP.PORT=[number]
      The port to use to stop the running Jetty server.
      Required along with STOP.KEY if you want to use the --stop option above.
  STOP.KEY=[alphanumeric]
      The passphrase defined to stop the server.
      Requried along with STOP.PORT if you want to use the --stop option above.
  DEBUG=true
      Enable debug on the start mechanism.  ( Note this is not equivalent
      to enabling debug on the logging mechanism of the started server).
      (default: false)
  OPTIONS=[option,option,...]
      Classpath Options to use.  By convention, option names starting with capitals
      will include associated options (eg Server includes jetty-server, jetty-webapp,
      jetty-deploy, etc). An option starting with a lowercase letter includes 
      just the direct dependencies of the option (eg jsp includes just jetty-jsp 
      module and it's dependencies).
      (default: "default,*")
