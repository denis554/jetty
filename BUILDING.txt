Jetty is built with maven >= 2.0.8

Currently there is not eclipse maven repository and we are not yet
cleared to make releases to the public maven repositories.  Thus in
order to build jetty, you need to locally check out and build
two modules used by the build system:

  cd /my/work/directory
  svn co http://dev.eclipse.org/svnroot/rt/org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-parent/trunk/jetty-parent jetty-parent
  cd jetty-parent
  mvn install
  cd ..
  svn co svn+ssh://gwilkins@dev.eclipse.org/svnroot/rt/org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-toolchain/trunk jetty-toolchain
  cd jetty-toolchain
  mvn install
  cd ..

You can then build this project:

  cd /my/work/directory/jetty-7
  mvn install
